            <p class=".aboutinfo">Refugee Stories is a platform aimed at shining a light at the ongoing refugee crisis and providing a safe space for people 
                to share their stories. We hope people visiting the site will gain a better understanding of the refugee crisis and what it 
                means to be a refugee. </p>
                <p class="aboutinfo"> There are more people displaced in the world today than at any time since the end of World War II and
                 it is more important than ever to help people develop empathy for each other.</p>
